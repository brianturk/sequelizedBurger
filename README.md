## What this project does
This project uses MySQL, Node, Handlebars, and ORM to make an app that allows you to keep track of the burgers you want to try and the ones you have tried.


## Additional Notes
* There is sound when "devouring" a burger, so make sure to not be on mute
* I added a delete function on the eaten burgers
