## What this project does
This project uses MySQL, Node, Handlebars, and Sequelized to make an app that allows you to keep track of the burgers you want to try and the ones you have tried.


## Additional Notes
* There is sound when "devouring" a burger, so make sure to not be on mute
* I added a delete function on the eaten burgers
* I added a 'Buddy' table and a 'BurgerBuddy' table.  Everytime you Devour a burger, you can put down the person you had the burger with
* There is validation on the Buddy name so that way there are no two buddy names that are the same
